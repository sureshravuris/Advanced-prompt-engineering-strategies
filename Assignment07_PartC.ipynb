            "**Process Explanation:**\n",
            "The journey of blood starts in the heart. The heart is divided into four chambers - the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium and then flows into the right ventricle. From there, it is pumped to the lungs to pick up oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once the blood is oxygenated in the lungs, it returns to the heart and enters the left atrium. It then flows into the left ventricle, which pumps the oxygen-rich blood out to the rest of the body through arteries. As the blood travels through the arteries, it delivers oxygen and nutrients to cells and tissues.\n",
            "\n",
            "After delivering oxygen and nutrients, the blood becomes deoxygenated and picks up waste products. It then travels back to the heart through veins. The cycle repeats as the heart pumps the blood to the lungs for oxygenation and then out to the body again.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Conclusion:**\n",
