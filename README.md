# Advanced Prompt Engineering Strategies

## **Assignment Overview**
This repository contains the implementation of advanced prompt engineering strategies using **GPT-4** or **GPT-3.5**. The project illustrates key techniques, solves failure cases, and includes practical examples across various fields.

---

## **Introduction**
This project is part of the Advanced Prompt Engineering Strategies assignment and showcases:
- Prompt engineering techniques with failure cases and solutions.
- 21 diverse prompt templates with practical examples.
- Use of OpenAI and PaLM 2 APIs for various prompt engineering use cases.

The Colab notebook includes all tasks with explanations and examples.
